Hi, my name is Eric Riesberg and I am a young professional looking to gain a career in Data Analytics.

I am interested in using data to solve complicated problems, and provide insights that allow us to move forward as people, and in communities.

I'm currently learning about how to use tools like Python, SQL, and Tableau to more effectively evaluate and communicate data to others.

I am available via email:
